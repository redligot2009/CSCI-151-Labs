# CSCI 151 Lab Activities + Final Project

I compiled my activities that I hastily did for my CSCI 151 (Web Programming) class. At least my suffering doing raw HTML DOM Manipulation through vanilla JavaScript will not have gone to total waste.

After this, I'm glad I will never have to do manual DOM manipulations, etc. again with the variety of libraries / frameworks like React / Vue / Angular. 

## Lab 2
- 3 responsive cards layout implemented with CSS Flexbox, and with CSS Grid.


## Lab 3
- A bunch of "boards" that can be collapsed via buttons. Implemented through really basic JavaScript.


## Lab 4
- Fetching images from the Chicago Art Gallery API in 2 different ways (XMLHTTPRequest ü§¢ and Fetch API ‚ù§)

## Final Project
- "Online gallery" of sorts that fetches data from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API, and allows you to search artworks related to a specific query, filter by "department", and by highlight status (e.g. artworks considered as highlights by the museum).
- Uses Fetch API for data fetching, CSS Grid for artwork card layouts, vanilla JS for most of the DOM manipulation, and Bootstrap + JQuery for modal window to view full image,
